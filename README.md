# Sprint-Review-and-Retrospective

### How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

As a Product Owner, asking questions to client regarding the needs of the application is essential to creating user stories. User stories will be able to help developers engage on what needs to be create to satisfy the requested application. User stories are designed to target what functionality it needs to complete the task.

### How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

Communication is really important in a scrum-agile-approach. It is essential to communicate with transparency among the scrum team. If anything I would incorporate more transparent communication in the future software development. I would seek more assistance when stuck and have more clear and transparent communication. Imposter syndrome is real when you are starting out as a software engineer and one of the hardest tackle in sprint meeting is transparent communication.

### What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

To be a good team member, you need to show positive to fellow team members. Trust your team members and never put your members down. Any sort of judgement is not needed in a agile environment as it is fast paced and can easily become a stressful environment. Learn to help each other and learn from one another. One should act as a team member and not someone above one another. It is absolutely important to have coherent team for successful SDLC.
